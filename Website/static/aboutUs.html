            <h2>Behind Your Health Insights</h2>
            <p>
                This project was born from the desire to make healthcare more accessible and understandable for everyone. In the current system, many patients face a major challenge: interpreting their blood test results. Often complex and technical, these data can cause anxiety or uncertainty. We aimed to solve this issue by providing clear and accessible explanations, while also helping with the early detection of heart disease. Our goal is to equip everyone with the tools needed to better understand their health and make informed decisions, relying on reliable information and in-depth analysis.<br><br>Our team developed a website that enables patients to enter their blood test results on the “Blood Analysis” page. After submitting their data, they can request a risk assessment. A machine learning model then analyzes the blood test results to predict whether the patient is at risk of developing heart disease based on their data.
